But what you might not know is that GitHub isn’t just a storage locker, but also a showcase. That is, GitHub allows you to set up a bare-bones website you can use to display projects and collaborate.

Welcome to GitHub Pages, the glossy, forward facing side of the site. Unlike the dense repositories that would confuse your less tech-savvy friends, Pages are ordinary looking websites that GitHub hosts for free.

GitHub Pages, which are a bit like Git with training wheels, let you explore repository building without ever leaving the website. No command line coding here: GitHub Pages lets you make a documented change, or "commit," to the site simply by clicking “OK.”</h3>
